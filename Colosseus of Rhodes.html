              The Colossus of Rhodes is a statue of Helios, the Sun God of
              Greece. Found on Rhodes, a small island of greece, it is one of
              the seven wonders, because at the time it was the biggest statue
              in the world. It was built to celebrate the successful defense of
              Rhodes against enemy invaders. <br /><br />
              The man who constructed it is Charles of Lindos, a famous greek
              Sculptor. It was made in 280 BC, or about 2300 years ago.
